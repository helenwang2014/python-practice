Reading and Writing files in Python:

In Python, you don't need to import library to read and write files.
The first step is to get a file object.
The way to do this is to use the open function.

file_object = open(filename, mode)



The modes can be:

'r' when the file will only be read

'w' for only writing (an existing file with the same name will be erased)

'a' opens the file for appending; any data written to the file is automatically
added to the end. 

'r+' opens the file for both reading and writing.

>>> f = open('filename', 'w')
>>> print f.read()
