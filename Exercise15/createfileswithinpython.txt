Create a text file

Let's first create a new text file. You can name it anything you like,
in this example we will name it "newfile.txt".

file = open("newfile.txt", "w")

file.write("hello world in the new file\n")

file.write("and another line\n")

file.close()

If we now look in the newfile.txt, we can see the text that we wrote:


$ cat newfile.txt 
hello world in the new file
and another line
